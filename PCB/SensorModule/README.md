Provided as if, make sure to check that everything works before ordering.
This is a scrapped design for connecting the hall sensors but I wasn't happy with the end result, it was real tricky making sure the pins reached the pcb and didn't connect to the other pins, but figured I can share it if someone wants to improve it.
This pcb was improved into the "SensorModule 2Part" in the folder above.
